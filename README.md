IEOR 4572-002: Data Analytics &amp; Python for Operations Research

This repository contains various projects I worked on as a student in IOER 4572-002 Data Analytics & Python for Operations Research in
Spring 2017. During this course we discussed introductory data science theory and technique and the capacity of the Python machine
learning stack to carry out basic data analysis. We completed units on web scraping, text mining, relational databases, and real-time
reporting with web applications. I've uploaded a few of the more extensive and interesting projects assigned to us in class.

The programming assignments in this course were all written in Python.
