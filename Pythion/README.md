These files comprise my group's submission for the final project of the course. This project was an open-ended assignment where each
team selected and submitted a public dataset for review and then created a web application that would manipulate the dataset in real
time and return some useful result.

Our project manipulates data made publicly available by the World Health Organization to create a linear regression model that plots
the correlation between various selected parameters such as access to contraceptive methods or rates of teenage smoking and the average
lifespan of a given geographic region. This project utilizes various data scraping, statistical analysis, and web application libraries.

Our group named itself "The Pythion Oracle," a reference to the Pythian Oracle at Delphi, a figure of Greek mythology known for its
otherworldly precognition.
